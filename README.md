# R'Beauty Website

R'Beauty is a make up artist based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. She is a consumate professional, talented, reliable and enthusiastic about
hairdressing and makeup. R'Beauty offers all of her services at her studio including hairstyles and makeup lessons, and also travels to clients 
through out The Netherlands as required. 

R'Beauty works on beautiful weddings, commercial shoots, special occasions, corporate events and can always work with multiple clients as 
when needed. 

# UX
Basically, the website is for my girlfriend. She's a student in The Netherlands and she does make up services as a part time job.
Currently, her online presence is only on Instagram and on facebook. She feels that for her business to get proper exposure, she needs to 
have a website. So in essence, she needs a website in order to boost her online presence and also to have a web presence which hitherto, 
was missing. 
This project is going to provide the layout for her website when it gets hosted eventually. This project isn't just to be graded but 
the goal is fot it to be hosted and actually be the official website for my girlfriend.

I personally feel that by buildong a website for my girlfriend, it would boost her business image online and also attract more customers.

# Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

# Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
